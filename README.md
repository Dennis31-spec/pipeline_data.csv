# 📈 Sales Pipeline Health Monitor: Data-Driven BDR Insights

This project is a Python-based analytical tool designed to simulate the data analysis a BDR or Sales professional would perform to optimize their pipeline performance. 

It demonstrates the ability to identify key metrics, calculate sales velocity, and spot potential bottlenecks—all critical skills for a high-impact BDR who partners with Account Executives.

## 🔬 Purpose and Sales Application

Sales organizations thrive on predictability and efficiency. This script takes simulated CRM data (`pipeline_data.csv`) and extracts actionable insights:

1.  **Pipeline Value:** Totals for active, won, and lost deals.
2.  **Sales Velocity:** Calculates the average time deals spend in crucial stages (`Discovery`, `Proposal`, `Negotiation`).
3.  **Bottleneck Identification:** Flagging stages where deals are stagnating (e.g., spending more than 20 days on average). **This is crucial for focusing BDR outreach and AE resources.**

## 💻 How to Run the Monitor
